       "  'text': \"World Economic Forum\\n\\nDavos, Switzerland\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Madam Ambassador, thanks for putting together a crowd for us. (Laughter.)\\n\\nFolks, I’m delighted to be here and happy to be back with so many distinguished people. And I mean that sincerely. Many of you know as much or more about the subjects I’m going to speak to than I do, including -- is Elizabeth Blackburn here? Elizabeth, a Nobel Laureate, who found the BRCA gene. As that old saying goes, she’s forgotten more about this than I’m going to know.\\n\\nBut, folks, I’m happy to be back here at the World Economic Forum at Davos to talk about the fight against cancer. And I’m accompanied by Greg Simon, who is Executive Director of administration’s Cancer Moonshot and who will lead my Biden Cancer Initiative that I’ll launch after we leave office, which is in about 48 hours. (Laughter.) I hope I have a ride home. (Laughter.) I’ll talk about in a few moments.\\n\\nBut, Greg, where are you? Greg has had a great deal of experience in this area and he’s led the initiative the last year for the President and me.\\n\\nLast year, I arrived at the forum a few days after President Obama delivered his final State of the Union Address, where he announced, quite frankly to my surprise, that he was putting me in charge of a national Cancer Moonshot to double the rate of progress in preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer.\\n\\nAnd I was not only genuinely surprised by the announcement, I was genuinely surprised by the response that I got both at home and abroad. Here at Davos I was scheduled -- Klaus had asked me to deliver the keynote address on the promise and perils of the\\n\\nFourth Industrial Revolution, and to participate in a few bilateral meetings over the remaining days.\\n\\nBut given the overwhelming interest in the Cancer Moonshot, the forum asked me if I could quickly convene a roundtable of cancer experts, among whom Elizabeth was one of them, to discuss where we are and where we need to go in the fight against cancer.\\n\\nAnd so I did on a few days notice -- we put together such a roundtable -- and it kicked off what for me was a year-long journey that’s taken me literally around the world meeting with the best cancer researchers, doctors, nurses, and patients, as well as philanthropists, heads of state -- they've all been part of it.\\n\\nBut I’m back here today to outline how far we’ve come and what -- at least from our perspective -- what path we should chart moving forward.\\n\\nAnd let me start with where we believe we are. When we announced the Cancer Moonshot, I knew there would be a lot of skeptics out there who’d say, “well, here we go again. Haven’t we done this before?”\\n\\nPresident Nixon, when he declared War on Cancer in 1971, he was earnest and sincere and very committed. But what makes the difference between then and now is -- the single big difference is that he had no army. He had no resources. He had no weapons. He had no strategy to win.\\n\\nBut after 45 years with many of you in this room doing incredible work, 45 years of progress, after decades of funding research, training scientists and physicians, treating millions of patients, we now have an army. We now have powerful new technologies and tools, like: Immunotherapy that -- by the way, even six, eight, 10 years ago was viewed kind of as a voodoo science out there. It wasn’t really an integral part of this fight -- that makes cancer cells visible to the immune system so our natural defenses can destroy the cancer.\\n\\nSurgeons are using cutting-edge robotics to allow for more precise imaging to find the cancer and more precisely surgically remove the cancer in hard-to-reach areas.\\n\\nLiquid biopsies that find early signs of cancer in the blood and tell you whether or not you have a particular cancer.\\n\\nThese advances and many others provide hope that more precise medicines and diagnostics might greatly improve and detect and defeat cancer.\\n\\nBut on so many levels, we’ve now reached an inflection point. When the system was set up before, we thought there was basically only one cancer in different parts of the body. We’ve now learned there are over 200 specific kinds of cancers.\\n\\nAfter decades we thought we could tackle cancer one discipline at a time. But that's not how cancer operates. Cancer uses every tool at its disposal -- it hides from the immune system, it builds it own blood supply system, it uses viruses to spread, it engineers a friendlier environment, a cellular environment in which to survive.\\n\\nAnd it knows how to spread through the body using pathways and mutations we don’t understand fully yet. And cancer never gives up, it never surrenders. That's why we have to use every discipline cancer does, and that's what we’re starting to in a way that's only really begun in the last five or six, seven years.\\n\\nFive years ago as I said, oncologists weren’t routinely working closely with immunologists, virologists, geneticists, chemical and biological engineers. And now they are.\\n\\nImmunotherapies are finding the keys to making cancer cells visible and targeting them. Virologist are now working on vaccines to prevent and treat cancers. Geneticists are cataloging mutations that drive cancers. And chemical and biological engineers are helping engineer environments hostile to cancer. And they’re all working together.\\n\\nLike many of you, I decided to become acquainted with this after someone close to me in my family was diagnosed. You tend to try to learn everything you possibly can once that occurs. And I knew little about the discipline. And like I said, what impressed me was that so much of this is really very brand new in terms of the collaboration.\\n\\nAlso, there’s a recognition that by aggregating and sharing millions of patients’ data, like genomics, family history, lifestyles, treatment outcomes and by using supercomputing power that we can do now a million billion calculations a second, we can understand why one therapy or treatment works for one person and not for another for the same exact cancer.\\n\\nAnd today, it was just announced that two major data sharing organizations, who were part of the roundtable. Five of them were here when we had the roundtable last year, two of them -- Cancer LinQ and another that focuses on genomic information called Project Genie -- are joining forces to accelerate data sharing of real-world clinical data that will improve cancers.\\n\\nAfter the meeting we had here, I asked the five groups that we're focusing on data sharing -- on aggregating data, I asked them whether they’d meet with me in Washington privately. And they came to my office, and we sat for an hour and a half. And I asked each of them to explain to me -- help educate me as to what they were doing. And I remember when we finished saying something that will not surprise you all, but you said, didn't you know that, Joe? I looked and said, but it sounds like you're all doing the same thing. No, I’m not being facetious. I said, you've all just made the case to me the more data you can aggregate across a spectrum, the more likely you are to find patterns, the most likely you are to find cures and/or treatments. Why aren’t you talking to one another?\\n\\nAnd I remember afterwards several of them walking up to me as we were having coffee and pulling me aside and say, keep this up. Keep this up. But I didn't -- I had nothing to do with this sharing and collaboration. But the point is the mood is changing as I feel it just in the last year.\\n\\nI also learned from the best minds in the world that the strategy we’ve been following is equivalent to fighting the last war. The model of scientific breakthroughs for most of the history was one of individual achievement, Jonas Salk in the laboratory finding the -- creating the polio vaccine. There was little -- if any -- sharing among hospitals and researchers, and little ability to share even if they wanted to share.\\n\\nAnd across the world, our funding processes and systems of academic research primarily follow that old model. So the Moonshot has fundamentally been about two things since I began it. And the first objective I’ve had was to inject the urgency of now into this fight and double the rate of progress and do in five years instead of 10.\\n\\nAnd when I say urgency of now, the brightest minds I’ve met in the world -- and I’ve been doing my job and mostly working on strategic doctrine and foreign policy my career -- the brightest people I’ve met, I’ve met now and spoken with over 13,000 cancer researchers in the two major organizations. I’ve met with scores and scores of leaders in the field. I’ve met with seven or eight Nobel Laureates in the field. And the amazing thing to me is that they're all working so hard. But with a few changes, even without learning more information, we could probably extend the life of a lot of people.\\n\\nThe one thing that the clinicians can tell you is -- and those of you who are clinicians -- how many times have you had a patient say to you, Doctor, can you just -- I know you can't save me, but can you just give me two more weeks so I can watch her get married, doc? Doc, can you just keep me around for another month so I can see my first grandchild born, doc? Doc, I’m not asking for anything except can you just extend a little bit? I might be able to get my finances in order.\\n\\nYou hear that all the time. I heard that at my son’s beside. He wasn’t afraid of dying, but he wanted to settle a few things. Greater collaboration with no new breakthroughs can have the possibility of being able to say to one in four or five of those patients, yes, I can figure a way, just a little longer.\\n\\nThe second thing, objective I had was changing the culture, coming up with a new strategy for this fight. Not for the strategy for the last fight.\\n\\nWe have four primary structures for organizing the Moonshot. One, we established the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force to reimagine the federal government’s fight and role in this fight to break down silos in the federal government. I went all over the world literally asking for suggestions: What should we be doing better?\\n\\nUnder this task force, which I engaged and Greg met with members of each of the departments at least once every two weeks for updates on progress that was being made on things we were trying to do, we engaged everyone from the National Institutes of Health, to the Defense Department and to Veterans Affairs -- but to some agencies never been involved. NASA -- everybody would go why in the hell are they bringing NASA into this, or the Patent Office, or the Environmental Protection Agency, or the White House policy councils, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, they all have a role to play.\\n\\nSecondly, we hosted a Cancer Moonshot Summit in June. Some of you participated in that summit. We held it in D.C., over 400 of you came. We had roundtables on various aspects of dealing with cancer. Some of you were there, made significant contributions. But interestingly enough, we simulcast, in effect, these roundtables where 7,000 people around the country gathered in 300 local summits held in every single state, including Guam and Puerto Rico to try to again inject this notion of the urgency of now.\\n\\nAnd the summit workshops launched a torrent of new collaborations and innovative initiatives across all sectors, and they continue to this day.\\n\\nFor example, we got a call from IBM. How would you like to borrow Watson? They came to us and offered Watson, their supercomputer, to partner with the largest hospital in the world, the Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs. So now a veteran can get her genome or tumor sequenced at Walter Reed, and they're very good at it and they can do it quickly, and then Watson will search all specific therapies that would target that particular cancer and provide recommendations to the physicians and tumor boards to use in choosing the right therapy. So you increase the prospect that the first time out will be the best shot out.\\n\\nIn June, I was at the University of Chicago, where we launched the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons. The purpose was to bring together cancer sequencing data and related patient information from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Well, that atlas comprised roughly 14,000 individuals with that data. Now the database has grown now to over 30,000 individuals. And our international agreements are going to add tens of thousands of more patients’ data.\\n\\nAnd Amazon came along and says, look, we’ll agree to make their cloud computing available to help us store these enormous amounts of data that this project is going to generate.\\n\\nBut the important thing is, that it’s a totally open-access database, able to be accessed by any researcher in the world, eliminating the silos. It did not exist a year ago. And this data has already been accessed and used more than 5 million times, and this was in the spring of last year -- increasing chances exponentially that we may find some answers.\\n\\nWe’ve also transformed access to cancer clinical trials. In the United States only 4 percent of the people diagnosed with cancer ever become part of a clinical trial, which is how research advances and may be the only possibility of saving the patient’s life. Maybe.\\n\\nSo we engaged the President’s Innovation Fellows, some of the top, young technology minds in the world, mostly from Silicon Valley, who have dedicated a year to come in. These are trying to modernize the whole government. So I went to them and said, look, there’s no way anyone can rationally go and figure out that that oncologist from Bemidji, Minnesota, who has come up with an accurate diagnosis doesn't know where to turn. He’s not near one of the great cancer centers in the United States. So where do they go?\\n\\nThere was a site that said you could click on and find out where there were cancer trials. But it was useless. So these brilliant, young -- they range in age from 25 to 40 thereabouts -- within three weeks put together a site. They can go now. It’s trials.cancer.gov. Type in real words like breast cancer, leukemia, and ZIP codes, age, and then find a list of clinical trials near you or your loved one that previously you could not have easily found. And find the people equally excited about this are the pharmaceutical companies. They have trouble finding enough people for their trials.\\n\\nYou and your doctor can now find out what trials are available for your types of cancer near you.\\n\\nAnother example is NASA I mentioned earlier, working with the National Cancer Institute, establishing a new collaboration to study the biological effects of particle beam radiotherapy, a novel technology that may deliver a more targeted dose of radiation to tumor cells.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advancing the effort to promote cancer vaccines like the HPV vaccine that are safe and effective strategies for combatting viruses -- for various types of cancer.\\n\\nThe Moonshot also initiated the Blood Profiling Atlas Pilot. Representatives from the government, academia, and pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies are launching partnerships to create an open database for liquid biopsies to accelerate the development of safe and effective blood profiling diagnostic technologies and our patient will benefit from this.\\n\\nStanford Medicine and the VA in Palo Alto are collaborating to establish the Hadron Center in Palo Alto, California, for the potential benefit of both Veteran and non-Veteran cancer patients.\\n\\nThe Hadron Center will utilize particle-beam radiotherapy using beams of charged particles such as proton and helium, carbon, or other ions to allow more precise targeting everywhere inside the patient's body, potentially -- we don't know yet -- resulting in less damage to healthy cells.\\n\\nThe reason NASA got in the game is they know more about radiation than anybody in the world, so they're participating.\\n\\nEarlier this year we announced what we call the NCI -- the National Cancer Institute Formulary. This is a public-private partnership with more than two dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which allows researchers to test existing drugs for new combinations that could be effective against different types of cancer.\\n\\nThis is how it works. When you go into a bar and you listen to a song and you put money in a jukebox, you don’t have to negotiate a licensing agreement with each song from the record company you're about to play. That licensing agreement has already been worked out.\\n\\nBut until recently, if you waited to use -- you've wanted to use a combination of drug, you had to go through each company, get permission to use each different drug. It literally could take years. And a lot of people got lost in the meantime that might have been saved.\\n\\nNow, the NCI has already worked out the details of intellectual property, access, and licensing so researchers and companies know there is an agreement on licensing if the drug is successful and how the intellectual property will be shared.\\n\\nThis new system just launched. And I urge as many of you as possible to join it, participate, and share. It will make an enormous difference potentially.\\n\\nCombination drugs have the potential to do for cancers what many of you have done for HIV. There was total collaboration in HIV.\\n\\nThere are dozens of other actions that you can read about in WhiteHouse.gov/CancerMoonshot.\\n\\nThe third thing we did was we created a Cancer Moonshot blue ribbon panel at our national institute to recommend research that holds the most promise for additional investments. Some of you were named to that panel. My dad used to have an expression. He said, Joey, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is important to you. What do the best minds in the world think are the best therapies or technologies we should be pursuing as rapidly as we can, in what order?\\n\\nThat blue ribbon panel delivered a report with transformative recommendations to change the research blueprint for the National Cancer Institute.\\n\\nFor example: Launching a 3-D Cancer Atlas. Oncologists today rely on past experience, consultation with multidisciplinary teams, published studies, and other sources to make diagnosis and treatment decisions.\\n\\nBut providing a web-based catalog of the genetic lesions and cellular interactions in a tumor, immune and other cells in the tumor, the microenvironment -- one that maps the evolution of tumor -- from development to metastasis, it’s going to enable researchers to develop predictive models for tumor progression and response to treatment that will ultimately help oncologists make informed treatment decisions for each patient\\n\\nNow none of this is a guaranteed promise. But it all holds significant potential. Establishing a national network of cancer patients that, with appropriate privacy safeguards, will provide them with a genetic profile of their own cancer and let them “pre-register” for clinical trials, so they can be contacted when a trial in which they may be eligible opens; establishing clinical trials networks devoted exclusively to immunotherapies for pediatric and adult cancers would advance research in this area and could lead to new vaccines to prevent cancers of all types in children, as well as adults; expanding the use of proven cancer prevention and early detection strategies.\\n\\nSeveral cancer prevention and risk reduction strategies have proven to be highly effective, including tobacco control, colorectal cancer screening, HPV vaccine.\\n\\nBoosting prevention research to identify ways to increase the uptake of these strategies, especially in medically underserved populations could greatly reduce the incidence and death from lung and other tobacco-related cancers, colorectal cancer, cervical and other HPV-related cancers, respectively.\\n\\nHere’s why it matters. By some estimates, at least 50 percent of the cancers can be prevented, and that prevention falls into three major categories:\\n\\nOne: Personal actions on the part of the individual, such as living a healthier lifestyle, avoiding cancer risk behaviors, like smoking.\\n\\nThe second way of prevention is the responsibilities of government and industry to reduce carcinogens and toxins in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we grow our food in.\\n\\nAnd the third is to make available existing diagnostic tools to all communities -- because we know the earlier cancer is detected, the better prospect for an outcome that's good.\\n\\nBut there is a fourth outcome, an entirely new set of diagnostic tools that can detect cancers earlier, new technologies like hereditary markers. Instead of waiting until you're 48 years old to get your first colonoscopy, if they have the marker, get it when you're 16 years old.\\n\\nAnd by continuing to keep an eye on it, prevent you from being the victim of dying of cancer -- of that cancer.\\n\\nThe fourth -- and in addition to the task force report, I was asked to deliver a report to the President in October that included the progress made ‘16 and my assessment -- and it’s only mine of what the road ahead looks like. Obviously, I would like you all to look at that and critique it.\\n\\nThe report lays out the changes we need in our view to implement -- to implement at our research institutions and universities to align our research system with the realities and opportunities of the 21st century.\\n\\nAnd all this has helped us make progress on the international fight against cancer.\\n\\nLast April I delivered remarks at conference on Regenerative Medicine hosted by the Vatican and that the Pope addressed as well. I laid out what I thought to be the guideposts for international collaboration through the Moonshot.\\n\\nOne: Focus on prevention, access, and affordability around the world.\\n\\nTwo: Raise the urgency of international response to cancer, reflecting the same urgency we bring to infectious disease threats. There are 16 Million people who will die from cancer this year. And according to many of the experts in the audience, if we don’t do anything about it, there will be 26 million dying by 2020.\\n\\nIncrease research and patient data sharing among researchers, institutions, foundations, nations. Support standardization of data and biorepositories. Increase government investment and cancer research -- we should increase it to capitalize on this moment, of this inflection point.\\n\\nSince then, the United States has signed 10 memoranda of understanding in nine countries.  I’m supposedly an expert on foreign policy. An expert is anyone from out of town with a briefcase. (Laughter.) I have traveled over 1.3 million miles for the President, meeting with heads of state, most of whom I’ve known most of my career. I was recently in the Gulf, the Persian Gulf recently, seven months ago, talking about the fight against ISIS with a head of state, sitting on the Gulf, the Persian Gulf, talking about -- he had his people lined up on one side of a table outside and I had mine for a dinner. And before we began, he said, Mr. Vice President, before we talk about ISIS -- they call it Daesh -- before we talk about Daesh, can we talk about cancer? We want to help.\\n\\nIn that tour through the Middle East in Jordan and Israel, can we talk about cancer?\\n\\nThe President put together and 50 heads of state came in the East Room with rectangular tables lined up around the entire room with 50 heads of state on how to deal with the nuclear proliferation. The President sat in front of the fireplace. And I was directly across from him, my back to that famous hallway. Before he began he said, I know a lot of you want to talk to Joe about cancer, but let’s deal with the nuclear issue first. (Laughter.) He wasn’t being facetious. The result -- whether I was in Melbourne, Japan, the UAE, we've signed -- we were sought after and signed 10 detailed memorandum of understanding as to how we should jointly proceed.\\n\\nThese have focused on data sharing and advanced research.\\n\\nLast month, we saw the United States Congress come together. I know I’m supposedly the guy that Republicans and Democrats like in the Congress. I actually respect the Congress. That's part of the problem that people think I have. But I genuinely do. And we could get anything through the Congress.\\n\\nBut through the leadership of some Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate, they put together what they call the 21st Century Cures Act, and no one thought we could pass it. At the very waning hours, we were able to go up and get them jointly to appropriate and commit to 6.3 billion in biomedical and health-related research, including $1.8 billion for the National Cancer Institute to invest in additional research as part of the Moonshot. This is the one bipartisan thing that exists, and I pray will continue to exist in the new administration.\\n\\nBut it also is an international consensus. So we have enormous opportunities I believe with greater collaboration, but organizing a different pathway than we've been following.\\n\\nThis investment, in my view, should be matched by other nations who agree that now is the time to double-down in our fight against cancer. And it’s my hope, as I’ve already spoken to the Vice President-elect, who is a good man, about to come in to be Vice President in four days or three days, about my willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration to be committed and enthusiastic as we are to the goal of ending cancer as we know it. And my prayer is they will do that, as well.\\n\\nBut I know those in the private sector, philanthropy, at academic institutions and non-profit organizations, will continue the work regardless of what the next administration does. There’s too much momentum here. And this will include me as a private citizen.\\n\\nI do not have -- I hope I’m well informed, but I don't have the expertise most of you have, but I’ve found I have the power to convene and thus far I’ve been viewed as a fair dealer. I have no interest in any one institution or another. And I maybe even have the ability to occasionally shame so people move in directions that up to now there’s been unwillingness to move because of the culture that's developed.\\n\\nAfter I leave office, after meeting with some very significant people who many of you know -- a coupe in this room as well -- who have encouraged me to set up the Biden Cancer Initiative with similar goals of the Moonshot, changing the way we do business in cancer research and development and providing cancer care.\\n\\nThe initiative will focus on, one, improving data standards and giving patients a mechanism to share their data, so they can help many other patients going through the same fight; and so researchers can use the data to find new patients and new cures. Most people are not experts like you. They think that already exists, that patients actually own their own data; that people -- they actually have access to their own data. I was with one particular researcher, and he said, well, we're having trouble getting patients. And I said, I tell you what, I’ll make you a bet -- the press was with me, like here -- I said, I bet if I ask them, their networks will give me 15 minutes of primetime to talk about this. I said, if I pick one single repository, I’ll bet you I get minimum between 2 million and 10 million patients who the next morning will give you their data, say they’ll send it there. And this researcher said, well, yes, maybe you have a point.\\n\\nGuys, this is not -- this is within our wheelhouse. That's the easy part. The hard part is what you all do.\\n\\nWorking with community care organizations to help improve access to care and quality of care is another focus that we'll have. So outcomes aren’t wholly dictated by your ZIP code.\\n\\nAnd convening a national conversation with pharmaceutical companies, insurers, biotech companies, and others to ensure patients can afford treatments. Too many Americans are forced to sell their homes, go into bankruptcy, just so a loved one can get the care and hope for the cure. That needs to change.\\n\\nAnd these companies need to have serious remuneration. They're taking real risks. But there’s got to be a way we can figure this out.\\n\\nAnd also calling for greater transparency and access to clinical trials, so more patients can get access to treatments that might work for their cancer.\\n\\nAnd continuing to work for cultural change and improvements in our cancer research system, so we can make the best use of today’s opportunities to generate, share and knowledge from patients and researchers to help patients everywhere around the world.\\n\\nThese are the reasons why I plan on staying involved -- because for the first time in 45 years, there is some real movement toward collaboration. Not because people are selfish, but because it wasn’t the model. It’s not the way it worked for good reason. But the collaboration between cancer centers, drug companies, the insurance industry, and government is where the solution lies -- and how we’ll end cancer as we know it.\\n\\nSo let me conclude by saying, which will not shock you: I am optimistic. (Laughter.) I know I’m always optimistic. But I am optimistic because of the absolute commitment and sheer brilliance I have been exposed to from so many researchers and scientists and these great institutions.\\n\\nI see the day when patients get the right therapy the first time for their cancer, where prevention is more effective, and\\n\\nwhere care is personalized and more effective with less harmful side effects.\\n\\nI see the day when those younger people of you in this room, when you take your children and grandchildren later for their school physical, that they will -- at the time they get their vaccination against measles and mumps, they’ll be vaccinated against certain types of cancer -- like you can be vaccinated against HPV virus.\\n\\nI see the day when we’ll be able to identify through markers in the blood, cancers that haven’t even developed yet.\\n\\nAnd the one thing I can tell you: There is hope.\\n\\nI’m willing to bet everyone in this room who has had cancer, or has a loved one who has had cancer, you understand that feeling when the doctor says, it’s cancer.\\n\\nYou all know, at that moment, the one thing you most need is some reason to hope.\\n\\nWhen President Kennedy discussed sending humankind to the moon, he talked about the commitment the nation -- and this is the phrase he used -- the commitment the nation was “unwilling to postpone.”\\n\\nA very famous speech, and some of you can probably recite the speech, but the part of the speech since I’ve been a kid that got me the most about my notion about governance, my notion about exploration, my notion about science was when a nation or a people “unwilling to postpone.” We should be unwilling to postpone finding the answer to how to end cancer as we know it.\\n\\nAnd I’m confident we can do it. You're already doing it. But let’s double down. It is about the urgency of now.\\n\\nI thank you all for your graciousness in listening and thank you for having me. (Applause.)\\n\\nEND\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Bankova\\n\\nKyiv, Ukraine\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr. President, I may have to call you once every couple weeks just to hear your voice. (Laughter.) This has been going on a long time.\\n\\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a great, pleasure to be once more here in Kyiv to reaffirm the depth of the partnership between our two peoples. This is my sixth visit to Ukraine as Vice President and my fifth in the year since the Revolution of Dignity on the Maidan, which was an astounding thing to witness when so many Ukrainian patriots stood up and demanded a future that this country has been too long denied.\\n\\nAnd I wanted to come here one more time on my last trip as Vice President to honor how much progress the people of Ukraine have achieved. This year marks the 25th year since Ukraine gained its independence. And the United States has been there to support and help you at every step of the way. Our partnership has spanned four different American Presidents from across our political spectrum. It has deep roots in both the Republican and Democratic parties.\\n\\nAs you saw a few weeks ago when two of my good friends from “the other side” -- former Senate colleagues John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Amy Klobuchar, of my party -- visited with Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the east.\\n\\nAnd that's because Americans and Ukrainians are united by deep bonds -- our shared values and our common hopes for the future. And the American people, including nearly 1 million proud Ukrainian Americans, understand that so much depends on your success, not just for Ukrainians, but for Europe and for the United States.\\n\\nIf you continue carrying your progress forward, then not only will you continue to build a more open, more democratic, more prosperous future that the Ukrainian people deserve, you will keep the international community united behind you in that effort.\\n\\nAnd I hope the next administration will also want to be a supporter and a partner in your continued progress. But as you know, no one else can do the hard work but the Ukrainian people. It’s up to Ukrainian leaders and people to put the needs of the country above narrow personal interest, to place the general good above point scoring and local prejudices. And that goes for everyone -- members of Ukraine’s government; representatives of the Rada, who took an oath to serve the Ukrainian people as a whole; judges who undertake the responsibility to dispense justice equally; members of the media and civil society and ordinary citizens whose job it is to hold those in power responsible.\\n\\nAs I said last year when I had the great honor to address the Rada, “Each of you has an obligation to answer the call of history and finally build a united, democratic Ukrainian nation that can stand the test of time.”\\n\\nYou're well underway to do that, Mr. President. So I wanted to thank you, Petro, not only for your leadership but for your friendship. I shared the same sentiment earlier this morning when I met Prime Minister Groysman earlier today. As a nation you've made a lot of very difficult decisions. And many more difficult political choices remain ahead. But there is no denying the progress that Ukraine has made since the Maidan. Together with a dynamic generation of Ukrainians committed to reform, you've begun to overhaul your government, your economy, your entire political system.\\n\\nIn the year since my last visit, you continue to meet the reform requirements in the IMF assistance package. You've strengthened the country’s banking sector. You protected Ukrainian depositors by nationalizing Privatbank. You implemented a groundbreaking, new electronic-asset-declaration system to fight corruption, which will help ensure that officials cannot leverage their political positions for personal gain.\\n\\nYour national anti-corruption bureau and the special anti-corruption prosecutor are providing and proving their impact when they have the resources. And it’s imperative that you continue to strengthen all of your anti-corruption institutions to root out those who would return Ukraine to rule by cronyism and kleptocracy.\\n\\nThanks to the vital steps you've taken, your economy is now growing again. But there remains much work to be done to ensure Ukraine finally realizes its potential as a vibrant, modern economy. Keep working with the IMF to implement the tough reforms that will make Ukraine’s economy sustainable. Continue cleaning up the banking system. Press forward with energy reforms that are eliminating Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas. Work to privatize state-owned enterprises transparently. Create a business environment with responsible, legal, and regulatory systems that make Ukraine a destination for investment. None of this will be easy. None of what you've done so far has been easy, but you've done it. And we know it’s going to be hard to continue to finish the job.\\n\\nYou're fighting both against the cancer of corruption, which continues to eat away at Ukraine’s democracy within, and the unrelenting aggression of the Kremlin.\\n\\nRussia’s continued attempts to undermine your success, your security, your sovereignty, and your territorial integrity are manifold. False propaganda attacks. Attempts to destabilize your economy. Ukraine, like every country in Europe, has a right to determine its own path. Yet Russia seeks to deny that choice. And the international community must continue to stand as one against Russian aggression and coercion.\\n\\nThere are over 1.7 million internally displaced people Oppression of Crimean Tatars continues. More than 9,600 Ukrainians have been killed in the fighting in the east and more than 22,000 wounded in the conflict. And fully one-fifth of those victims have been civilians.\\n\\nThat's why in addition to the $3 billion in loan guarantees and the $750 million in assistance to fortify your economic resilience, the United States has provided $600 million in security assistance. We've trained your national guard, conventional military forces, as well as special forces; helped you increase your readiness and make your force interoperable with NATO; provided armor, radars, night-vision devices, medical equipment -- all of which has saved lives and bolstered your defenses.\\n\\nTogether with our EU and G7 partners, we've made it clear that sanctions should remain in place until Russia fully -- I emphasize fully -- implements its commitments under the Minsk Agreement; and that the Crimea-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until Russia returns full control to the people of Ukraine.\\n\\nAlthough I know how -- you find this difficult to keep faith with the Minsk process when the Russians refuse to meet their security commitments, it remains the only viable framework for resolving the conflict in the Donbas, restoring Ukrainian governance in the east, and returning control of the international border to Ukraine. It’s Ukraine’s best hope to move forward as a united country.\\n\\nBut let me be perfectly clear, the political agreement cannot be implemented until Russian violence stops. Only after Russia and its proxies in the east fulfill their obligation to end the fighting and let the Donbas again enjoy peace and security can Ukraine be expected to fulfill its political commitments.\\n\\nIt’s no secret that Russia does not want you to succeed, Mr. President. It’s not just about Ukraine. It’s about the future we have long sought of a Europe whole, free, and at peace -- whole, free, and at peace -- something that is in the vital national interest of both the United States and all Europeans.\\n\\nYour self-determination, your freedom from coercion, your success as a liberal democracy are all essential in realizing this objective.\\n\\nSo I strongly urge the people of Ukraine: Keep demonstrating your commitment to the rule of law; keep fighting corruption; insist on transparency; investigate and prosecute government officials who siphon off public funds for their own enrichment. Russia over the last decade or so has used another foreign policy weapon. It uses corruption as a tool of coercion to keep Ukraine vulnerable and dependent. So pursue those reforms to root out corruption.\\n\\nIt’s not just about good governance. It’s about self-preservation. It’s about your very national security. It’s not just about good governance. As I said at the beginning, this year our nations celebrate 25 years of diplomatic relations. Over that time progress has come in fits and starts. Sometimes we move forward, sometimes backwards.\\n\\nBut the Ukrainian people are like the American people, they never give up. And one of the things that gives me the most hope for the future is the incredible energy and passion of Ukraine’s young people. I’ve met with them on each of my previous visits here. And I have no doubt that they will inspire, demand, and ultimately succeed in attaining the Ukraine that has been sought for for so long.\\n\\nOn a personal note, Mr. President, I want say what a privilege it has been to support and stand with Ukraine over these past 25 years -- first as a senator and of late as Vice President.\\n\\nI’ve been inspired by your people, their courage, their resilience, brave Ukrainians who never gave up hope for a future of something better, who get up and go to work every day for a democratic and united Ukraine.\\n\\nAnd if you can continue to make progress, Mr. President, if you keep doing the hard work and making the difficult choices to put Ukraine first, I promise you the American people will stand with you. This next year is going to be a very, very telling year -- a very telling year.\\n\\nThere is a line that John Kennedy used in deciding to go to the moon. He said, America is doing it because we can no longer -- we're no longer willing to postpone. I believe the Ukrainian people are no longer willing to postpone a free, open, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine. So seize it.\\n\\nI’m looking forward to seeing what our nations can build together, Mr. President, over the next 25 years and beyond because as my grandfather would say, with the grace of the God, and the good will of the neighbors, which we can't count on very much in this neighborhood, we can get this done. But it all depends on the willingness of your people to continue to insist on what they deserve because they deserve it.\\n\\nEND\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'East Room\\n\\n1:40 P.M. EST\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: They said this day would never come. (Laughter and applause.) Here is something none of my predecessors ever got a chance to say: Welcome to the White House the World Series Champion, Chicago Cubs! (Applause.)\\n\\nNow, I know you guys would prefer to stand the whole time, but sit down.\\n\\nI will say to the Cubs: It took you long enough. I mean, I’ve only got four days left. You\\'re just making it under the wire. (Laughter.)\\n\\nNow, listen, I made a lot of promises in 2008. We’ve managed to fulfill a large number of them. But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these eight years we would see the Cubs win the World Series. But I did say that there\\'s never been anything false about hope. (Laughter and applause.) Hope -- the audacity of hope.\\n\\nPARTICIPANT: Yes, we can!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can.\\n\\nNow, listen, for those of you from Chicago who have known me a long time, it is no secret that there\\'s a certain South Side team that has my loyalty. For me, the drought hasn’t been as long. We had the ’85 Bears; we had the the Bulls’ run in the ‘90s. I’ve hosted the Blackhawks a number of times. The White Sox did win just 11 years ago with Ozzie and Konerko and Buerhle. So I can\\'t claim that I have the same visceral joy of some in this White House. (Laughter.)\\n\\nBut FLOTUS is a lifelong Cubs fan. (Applause.) And I will tell you, she had to go to another event, but in eight years that I\\'ve been here -- I told the team this -- in the eight years that I\\'ve been here, we\\'ve hosted at least 50 teams -- football, basketball, baseball, soccer, you name it -- Michelle has never come to a single event celebrating a champion until today. (Applause.) And she came and shook hands, and met with every one of these members of the Cubs organization, and told a story about what it meant for her to be able to see them win, because she remembers coming home from school and her dad would be watching a Cubs game, and the bond and the family, the meaning that the Cubs had for her in terms of connecting with her father and why it meant so much for her. And I almost choked up listening to it. And it spoke, I think, to how people feel about this organization, and that it\\'s been passed on generation after generation, and it\\'s more than sports.\\n\\nAnd that is not just true for FLOTUS. My longest-serving aide, Anita, is a Cubs fan. (Applause.) \"Fan\" is not enough. When they won, the next day she said, this is the best day of my life. ((Laughter.) And I said, what about me winning the presidency? What about your wedding day? She\\'s like, \"No, this is the best.\" My chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan -- (applause) -- Cubs fan. In fact, there were a lot of sick days during the playoffs. (Laughter.) One of my staff members was caught being interviewed at a bar outside of Wrigley -- (laughter) -- and we\\'re watching him being interviewed. You remember? And he\\'s looking kind of sheepish about it. It\\'s like, why aren’t you in the office? (Laughter.)\\n\\nBut, look, the truth is, there was a reason not just that people felt good about the Cubs winning. There was something about this particular Cubs team winning that people felt good about. For example, David Ross and I have something in common -- we’ve both been on a “year-long retirement party.” (Laughter and applause.) But unlike Grandpa, my team has not yet bought me a scooter with a motorized golf caddy. But there are four days left -- maybe I\\'ll get that.\\n\\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, Teddy Roosevelt was President. Albert Einstein -- or was it Thomas Edison was still alive. The first Cubs radio broadcast wouldn’t be for almost two decades. We’ve been through World Wars, a Cold War, a Depression, space race, all manner of social and technological change. But during that time, those decades were also marked by Phil Cavarretta and Ernie Banks; Billy Williams, who\\'s here today -- (applause) -- Ron Santo; Ferg, Ryne Sandberg, Dawson, Maddux, Grace. Those decades were punctuated by Lee Elia’s rants and Harry Caray’s exuberance; “Hey Hey,” and “Holy Cow,” and capped off by “Go Cubs Go.”\\n\\nSo the first thing that made this championship so special for so many is, is that the Cubs know what it\\'s like to be loyal, and to persevere and to hope, and to suffer, and then keep on hoping. And it’s a generational thing. That\\'s what you heard Michelle describing. People all across the city remember the first time a parent took them to Wrigley, where memories of climbing into dad\\'s lap to watch games on WGN -- and that’s part of the reason, by the way, why Michelle had invited -- made sure that José Cardenal was here, because that was her favorite player. (Applause.) And she was describing -- back then he had a big afro, and she was describing how she used to wear her hat over her afro the same way José did.\\n\\nYou could see all that love this season in the fans who traveled to their dads’ gravesites to listen to games on the radio; who wore their moms’ old jerseys to games; who covered the brick walls of Wrigley with love notes in chalk to departed fans whose lifelong faith was finally fulfilled.\\n\\nNone of this, of course, would have happened without the extraordinary contributions of the Ricketts family. Tom met his wife, Cece, in the bleachers of Wrigley about 30 years ago -- which is about 30 years longer than most of relationships that begin there last. (Laughter and applause.) Our dear friend Laura Ricketts met her wife, Brooke, in the ballpark, as well.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters -- they turned this team around by hiring what has to be one of the greatest, if not -- I mean, he\\'s still pretty young, so we\\'ll see how long he keeps on going -- the greatest general managers of all time, Theo Epstein -- (applause) -- and along with Jed Hoyer and Jason McLeod. They did just an unbelievable job. Theo, as you know -- his job is to quench droughts. 86 years in Boston; 108 in Chicago. He takes the reins of an organization that\\'s wandering in the wilderness, he delivers them to the Promised Land. I\\'ve talked to him about being DNC chair. (Laughter and applause.) But he decided wisely to stick to baseball.\\n\\nThat brings me to the other thing that was so special about this championship -- and that\\'s just the guys behind me, the team. They steamrolled the majors this year with a 103-win record. All you had to know about this team was encapsulated in that one moment in Game 5, down three games to one, do or die, in front of the home fans when David Ross and Jon Lester turned to each other and said, “I love you, man.\" And he said, \"I love you, too.” It was sort of like an Obama-Biden moment. (Laughter.)\\n\\nAnd then you\\'ve got the manager, Joe Maddon, who -- (applause) -- let\\'s face it, there are not a lot of coaches or managers who are as cool as this guy. Look how he looks right now. (Applause.) That\\'s cool. That\\'s cool. He used costume parties and his “Shaggin’ Wagon.” (Laughter.) So he\\'s got -- just saying -- he\\'s got a lot of tricks to motivate. But he’s also a master of tactics, and makes the right move at the right time: when to pinch hit, when to pinch run, when to make it rain -- (laughter) -- in Game 7 of the World Series. It was masterful. So he set the tone, but also some of the amazing players here set the tone.\\n\\nMy fellow “44” -- Anthony Rizzo, the heart of this team. (Applause.) Five years ago, he was a part of the squad that lost 101 games. He stuck at it, and led the National League in All-Star votes this year.\\n\\nHis business partner in the “Bryzzo Souvenir Company,” which delivers baseballs to fans in all parts of the bleachers -- Kris Bryant. (Applause.) This guy had a good year. (Laughter.) You go from Rookie of the Year to being the MVP. You win the World Series. And then, like me, he marries up and comes to the White House. And he did all this just in 10 days -- (laughter) -- when it took me a long time. So, congratulations to the newlyweds, Jessica and Kris Bryant. (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd then you got these young guys like Baez and Russell. (Applause.)  Baez turning tagging into an art form. Russell becoming the youngest player to hit a World Series Grand Slam since Mickey Mantle. (Applause.) And you mix these amazing young talents with somebody like David Ross who, for example, helped Anthony out of his “glass case of emotions” in Game 7. (Applause.) But think about what Ross did in his final season: Caught a no-hitter, surpassed 100 home runs for his career, including one in his last game ever. If there was ever a way to go out, this was it.\\n\\nAnd then you got Ben Zobrist, who didn’t get to come to the White House last year after winning it all with the Royals, but then hits .357 in the World Series, go-ahead RBI in the 10th inning of Game 7, World Series MVP. I think he\\'s earned his way here. (Applause.) And is apparently a good guy, because I asked his wife -- she was in line before he was -- and I said, has he gotten a big head since he got the whole MVP thing? \"No, he\\'s so sweet, he\\'s so humble.\" You owe her dinner tonight. (Laughter.)\\n\\nExtraordinary pitching staff, including Kyle Hendricks, the first Cub to lead the majors in ERA since 1938. (Applause.) Kyle, in turn, was the only pitcher this year with a better ERA than Jon Lester, who racked up 19 wins. (Applause.) Good job. Jake Arrieta, 2015 Cy Young Award winner, stretched a 20-game win streak featuring two no-hitters across the past two seasons, then hit a home run in the NLDS, and won two games in the World Series. So, apparently Pilates works. Michelle says it does. (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd then, finally, the game itself and the Series itself. To come back from a 3-1 deficit against a great Cleveland Indians team forced what is widely considered the Game 7 of all time. Dexter Fowler becomes the first player to hit a leadoff home run in Game 7. (Applause.) Javy Baez hits another leadoff the fifth. David Ross becomes the oldest player to knock one out in a Game 7, as well. Kyle Schwarber, who\\'s been hurt and hobbled, then suddenly he comes in and gets seven hits in the Series -- three in Game 7 alone. (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd then you\\'ve got the 10th inning, you\\'ve got the rain. God finally feeling mercy on Cubs fans. An entire game, an entire season, an entire century of hope and heartbreak all coming down to a one-inning sprint. And then Zobrist knocked in one, Montero knocked in another. Carl Edwards, Jr. and Mike Montgomery teamed up to shut the Indians down.\\n\\nAnd then, at 12:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryant -- it looks like he\\'s going to slip; everybody is getting a little stressed -- tosses a grounder to Rizzo; Rizzo gets the ball, slips it in his back pocket -- (laughter) -- which shows excellent situational awareness. (Laughter and applause.) And suddenly everything is changed. No more black cats, billy goats, ghosts, flubbed grounders. The Chicago Cubs are the champs. And on ESPN, you\\'ve got Van Pelt saying, “one of the all-time great nights.” You\\'ve got Tim Kurkjian calling it “the greatest night of baseball in the history of the game.” Two days later, millions of people -- the largest gathering of Americans that I know of in Chicago. And for a moment, our hometown becomes the very definition of joy. So, in Chicago, I think it\\'s fair to say you guys will be popular for a while. (Laughter.)\\n\\nBut, in addition, they\\'re also doing a lot of good work. Anthony Rizzo and Jon Lester raised money to help others beat cancer like they did. (Applause.) Under the Ricketts Family’s leadership, last year alone, Cubs Charities supported charitable grants and donations of nearly $4 million that reached nearly 120,000 children and young adults across Chicagoland. (Applause.) Under their “Let’s Give” initiative, Cubs staff, coaches, players, and spouses donated more than 1,500 hours of service last year to the community. And after their visit here today, they will head to Walter Reed to visit with some of our brave wounded warriors. (Applause.)\\n\\nSo just to wrap up, today is, I think, our last official event -- isn\\'t it? -- at the White House, under my presidency. And it also happens to be a day that we celebrate one of the great Americans of all time, Martin Luther King, Jr. And later, as soon as we\\'re done here, Michelle and I are going to go over and do a service project, which is what we do every year to honor Dr. King. And it is worth remembering -- because sometimes people wonder, well why are you spending time on sports, there\\'s other stuff going on -- that throughout our history, sports has had this power to bring us together, even when the country is divided. Sports has changed attitudes and culture in ways that seem subtle but that ultimately made us think differently about ourselves and who we were. It is a game and it is celebration, but there\\'s a direct line between Jackie Robinson and me standing here. There\\'s a direct line between people loving Ernie Banks, and then the city being able to come together and work together in one spirit.\\n\\nI was in my hometown of Chicago on Tuesday, for my farewell address, and I said, sometimes it\\'s not enough just to change the laws, you got to change hearts. And sports has a way, sometimes, of changing hearts in a way that politics or business doesn’t. And sometimes it\\'s just a matter of us being able to escape and relax from the difficulties of our days, but sometimes it also speaks to something better in us. And when you see this group of folks of different shades and different backgrounds, and coming from different communities and neighborhoods all across the country, and then playing as one team and playing the right way, and celebrating each other and being joyous in that, that tells us a little something about what America is and what America can be.\\n\\nSo it is entirely appropriate that we celebrate the Cubs today, here in this White House, on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\\'s birthday because it helps direct us in terms of what this country has been and what it can be in the future.\\n\\nWith that, one more time, let\\'s congratulate the 2016 World Champion, Chicago Cubs! (Applause.)\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: Talk about a tough act to follow. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for inviting us. We\\'re all honored to be here today, and we appreciate you taking the time on such an important day, Martin Luther King Day, and during such a historic week, the last week of your distinguished presidency.\\n\\nAs told on my way in here, actually, by our club historian, it\\'s actually not the first time this franchise has visited the White House. It was 1888. (Laughter.) And we were known as the \"Chicago White Stockings,\" and we stopped in here to visit President Grover Cleveland. And apparently, the team demanded for a proclamation to be named the best baseball team in the country. The President refused, and the team went on their way. (Laughter.) Here we are, we\\'re going to make no such demands today. (Laughter.) But we appreciate those kind words.\\n\\nThe President was so kind to recognize our three Hall-of-Famers here with us today who are so synonymous with what it means to be a Cub -- Billy Williams, Fergie Jenkins, Ryne Sandberg. (Applause.) And, of course, José Cardenal, who got the longest hug from the First Lady we\\'ve ever seen -- her favorite player of all time, you\\'re the MVP today. (Laughter.)\\n\\nAnd I want to, one more time, recognize all of the Ricketts family who are here today. Tom, who\\'s been such an ideal leader for our organization. Laura, who\\'s been such a strong supporter of this President. And, Todd, who will embark on his journey in public service with a significant role in the new administration next week. And, Pete, who\\'s busy governing Nebraska, couldn’t be here, but sends his best.\\n\\nFinally, we\\'d like to recognize all of our wives and significant others who do so much to support us behind the scenes, our great \"Front Office,\" who have worked so hard. (Applause.)\\n\\nSo, Mr. President, as you alluded to in Cleveland on November 2nd, and into the early morning of November 3rd, this special group of players behind me, in one of the greatest World Series games in history, ended the longest championship drought in American sports. And when Kris Bryant\\'s throw settled into Anthony Rizzo\\'s glove for the final out of Game 7, the victory brought pride, joy, relief and redemption to Cub fans everywhere, including many in the White House. (Applause.)\\n\\nSo, many of you were there, but the city of Chicago erupted, unified into celebration that continues to this day. It was a thrilling, emotional time, and we think we even saw some White Sox fans smiling -- (laughter) -- which, Mr. President, brings us to you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: We know you may have a certain allegiance to another team on the other side of town, but we know you\\'re a very proud Chicagoan, and we know your better, wiser half, the First Lady -- (laughter) -- has been a life-long and very loyal Cub fan, which we appreciate very much. And, of course, we have great faith in your intelligence, your common sense, your pragmatism, your ability to recognize a good thing when you see one. (Laughter.)\\n\\nSo, Mr. President, with only a few days remaining in your tremendous presidency, we have taken the liberty here today of offering you a midnight pardon -- (laughter and applause) -- for all your indiscretions as a baseball fan. And so we welcome you with open arms today into the Cubs family. (Applause.)\\n\\nTo recognize this terrific conversion and this great day, we have some gifts for you and your family. First, Anthony Rizzo has graciously agreed to share his number 44 with \"The 44.\" (Applause.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: There we go!\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: And if you\\'re still not comfortable putting a Cubs jersey on, this one just says Chicago, so you\\'re good with that one. (Applause.)\\n\\nSecond, we have -- at historic Wrigley Field, we have a centerfield scoreboard that\\'s actually a historic landmark, and so we hope the National Park Service won\\'t mind, but we took down a tile for you, number 44. (Applause.) Very few people have one of those.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, that\\'s very cool.\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: We also wanted you to know that, as a new fan, you have some catching up to do. (Laughter.) And you\\'ve been busy the last eight years, and your family as well, so Laura Ricketts is here to present you with a lifetime pass to Wrigley Field for you and your family. (Applause.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love how it says, \"Non-transferrable.\" (Laughter.)\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: It\\'s strictly -- it\\'s just an emolument.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can you imagine if somebody walks up and is like -- (laughter) --\\n\\nMS. RICKETTS: You don’t have to bring it with you.\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: And finally, every time we win a game in Chicago, we fly the \"W\" flag, as you know. So we brought one for you, signed by the entire team, and we\\'d love for you to fly it at your new library, which we plan to do our very best to support. (Applause.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is nice swag. Thank you so much. This is great.\\n\\nMR. JENKINS: You got to get him to put the uniform on. (Laughter.)\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: It\\'s just day one. It\\'s just day one.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Fergie, we\\'re doing okay so far. (Laughter.)\\n\\nMR. EPSTEIN: So, Mr. President, thank you for the dignity and integrity with which you\\'ve served this country for the last eight years, for your tremendous service to Chicago and Illinois before that, and for hosting us here today. We wish you all the best and look forward to seeing you on Wrigley Field. (Applause.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, everybody, thank you so much. Let me say, first of all, best swag I\\'ve gotten as President represented right here. (Laughter.) And let me also say on behalf of a lot of folks here in the White House, you brought a lot of joy to a lot of people here, and we\\'re grateful. I know my former Chief of Staff, now mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel; folks like Dick Durbin, and we got a whole congressional delegation here; I see Lisa Madigan, my dear friend --- just a lot of people have been rooting for you for a long time.\\n\\nSo even though it will be hard for me, Fergie, to wear a jersey, do know that among Sox fans, I\\'m the Cubs number-one fan. (Laughter and applause.)\\n\\nEND\\n\\n2:12 P.M. EST'}]"
